# What are `PolicySets`

A `PolicySet` is a collection of policies that can be placed together instead of 
having to manage their placement individually. The intent of the `PolicySet` can 
be specified in the `description` field and the `status` of the `PolicySet` reflects 
the status of the policies that it contains. 

# Stable `PolicySets`

A stable `PolicySet` is a `PolicySet` that is tested and supported by Red Hat. These `PolicySets` work with little or no modifications.

# Community `PolicySets`

A community `PolicySet` is a `PolicySet` that has been contributed by the 
community. Community donations provide value, but that value might be 
specific to certain environments, or it may need changes to apply the solution 
to your environment. Some community `PolicySets` can provide samples showing 
how a problem can be solved for one user of the policy framework, which may 
or may not apply to other users.
